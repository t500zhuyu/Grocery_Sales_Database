In this project I used SQL to analyze different business questions
like:
- Analyze sales performance within the four-month period to identify trends and patterns
  - salesID as unique sale key identificator
  - sales date to get the month
    
- Top Products Identification by revenue
  - best performers
  - worst performers
  - best products by ID
    
- Customer Purchase Behavior
   - identify total purcharses by client
   - Identify repeat customers

- Salesperson Effectiveness
  - Check the number of sales by person
  - Analyze sales trends based on individual salesperson contributions over time

- Geographical Sales Insights
  - how sales are distributed across different cities
 
I also used Python to load the sales csv file due to is a file with more than 6 million rows, use Python is a easier way to load it, I also used Python to update the price column using the information from the products.
